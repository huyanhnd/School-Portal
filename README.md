```bash
git clone https://github.com/huyanhnd/school-portal.git
cd school-portal
```

## üìã API Design (Suggestions)

### POST `/teachers`

- **Purpose**: Add new teacher  
- **Request Body**:

```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "subject": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "contactNumber": "string"
}
```

- **Validation Rules**:
  - Email must be a valid gov email (`@moe.edu.sg` / `@gov.sg`)
  - Contact number must follow local format (e.g. 8 digits, start with 6/8/9)

> Suggestion: Use a request schema validation library (e.g. Joi, Zod) for robustness.

---

## üîç Assumptions

- A **simple in-memory or local database** is used during development.
- Only **basic validation** is enforced on email and contact number.
- No authentication is required for API access (public access assumed for demo).
- All frontend routes are static and handled via `react-router`.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- Add, list teachers
- Validation of input fields (frontend and backend)
- Clean UI with Ant Design
